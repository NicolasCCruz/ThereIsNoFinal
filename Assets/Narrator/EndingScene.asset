  - You win.
  - You finished the final project.
  - Guess I have no purpose anymore.
  - ...Huh.
  - "I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it."
  - Most players quit at the snack break.
  - Or got distracted trying to click the pause button forever.
  - But you... you *dragged words* to make progress.
  - "That\u2019s... oddly inspiring."

  - "And maybe... you\u2019re finally done with it."
  - Now go. Celebrate. Sleep. Touch grass. Submit it.
  - Seriously. Hit submit. Right now.
  - "\u2026"
  - "You\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t you."
  - "\u2026There *is* no post-credits scene. Go on. Git."
